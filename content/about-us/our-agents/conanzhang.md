## Bio

My name is Conan, and I am a passionate, innovative, self-driven, and reliable individual with a strong commitment to giving back to society through technology. 

At Case Zero Development, I have found a platform that allows me to harness my technical expertise to advance technological progress and promote inclusiveness in Singapore.

Throughout my journey, I have taken the initiative to develop numerous technical projects for the greater good, allowing me to deepen my knowledge and skills in the fields I serve. My academic achievements, combined with my hands-on experience, have allowed me to constantly push the boundaries of what is possible and strive for excellence.

While my experience may not be as extensive as others in my age group, I am proud to have earned recognition and awards that reflect my achievements and drive to constantly upskill and grow in the areas I am passionate about. I am deeply committed to positively impacting and inspiring others to do the same.

## My role at Vinosa Travel

As the IT Manager and Agent (Singapore) of Vinosa Travel, I oversee and manage the company's IT infrastructure, including developing and implementing the website, email services, and initiatives to promote youth volunteerism in Indonesia. 

In collaboration with the founder of Vinosa Travel as well as my team at Case Zero Development, Singapore , we play a pivotal role in fostering a strong partnership between our organisations, enabling us to provide more opportunities for youth engagement in overseas volunteerism initiatives. 

We are eager to establish relationships and work with a growing number of schools and organisations to achieve our shared goals.
